Aliens - Arcade Game

'Aliens' is a game I made while studying the PyGame package in Python.
It is a simple arcade game where you control a UFO using the arrows ↑(Up), ↓(Down), →(Right), ←(Left).
Your objective is to collect all the stars and bring them to Earth. But watch out, other aliens are attacking you!

(To start the game only run the main script)
